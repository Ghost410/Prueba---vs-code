Contrary to popular thought, Lorem Ipsum text is not simply random text. It has its roots in a
classic piece of Latin literature, dating back to 45 BC, making it more than 2000 years old.
Richard McClintock, a professor of Latin nice the University of Hampden-Sydney in Virginia, found one of
the most obscure words in the Latin language, "consecteur," in a passage of Lorem Ipsum, and as
he continued reading different Latin texts, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes
from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finnibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil)
by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during
the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line
in section 1.10.32
